    "body": "<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1 in 13 people has asthma.</p><p>Asthma is the most common chronic lung disease in children. It affects approximately 9 million children in the United States. Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing at night or early in the morning.</p><p>For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a significant problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Poorly controlled and undiagnosed asthma in young children can result in trips to the emergency room, hospital stays, missed workdays for parents, poor quality of life for the children, and even death.</p>",

Lilly refused to come to the school and bring an inhaler, as she had no additional inhalers for Jack.&nbsp; As such, the hospital has referred the case to DHS because they suspect Failure to Obtain Medical Attention.</p><p>Jack is being raised primarily by his mother, Lilly, who is reported to have severe asthma as well.
